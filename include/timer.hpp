 * GPU's Self-Organising Maps (S.O.M.)
 *
 * High Performance Computing
 * Work Assignment/Practical Lab's Project #1
 *
 * Description/Steps of operations performed by the GPU CUDA's Kernels:
 * - Implementation of Self-Organising Maps (S.O.M.), using the GPU's parallelism and optimisations
 *   with the support of the CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) API's extensions;
 * - This implementation was made in C++ (C Plus Plus);
 * - This project aims to compare the performances between,
 *   a version with CPU-based operations made by a sequential way,
 *   against a version with GPU-based operations and kernels (supported by CUDA),
 *   taking advantage of GPU's parallelism and optimisations;
